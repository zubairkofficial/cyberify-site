      "The legal industry has historically been rooted in manual processes. Law firms, courts, and legal professionals have relied on paper-based systems, in-person meetings, and human labor to handle cases, research, and client interactions. While these methods have served the industry for centuries, they often lead to inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs.\nIn recent years, however, there has been a significant push toward digitalization.From e-filing systems to case management platforms, technology has slowly but steadily started to replace traditional practices. But the real game-changer is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is taking legal tech to the next level by automating routine tasks, improving accuracy, and providing data-driven insights that were previously unimaginable.",
